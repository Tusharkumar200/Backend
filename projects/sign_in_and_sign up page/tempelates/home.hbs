        <h3>This is a simple home page to showcase inline CSS styling.</h3>

        <p>You can also format text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice
            of using the look from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall
            look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the Page Layout tab. To change the looks available in
            the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command.<br>
            Both the Themes gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore
            the look of your document to the original contained in your current template. On the Insert tab, the
            galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use
            these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks.
            When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look.<br>
